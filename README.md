# Image-Caption-Generator

Image captioning involves generating human-readable descriptions or sentences that accurately depict the content of an image. In this study, we propose an image caption generation utilizing two NLP techniques Greedy Search(argmax) and Beam Search. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), specifically the InceptionV3 model is used for image feature extraction. The combination of CV and NLP techniques are applied to a Facebook public multimodal dataset (PMD) comprising 566,747 training images and 25,010 test images. From this dataset, 16,000 training images are utilized for feature extraction and training the Natural Language Processing (NLP) model, while 1,600 test images are employed for feature extraction and testing the NLP model. The image caption generation techniques (Greedy Search and Beam Search) are compared based on BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy), ROUGE-L and METEOR score. Through comprehensive experimentation and evaluation, this study aims to provide insights into the comparative performance of different caption generation approaches.
